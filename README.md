Color Detection Bot
Project Desc. / Problem Statement:
Design a controller for an Autonomous
robot that can hit the coloured boxes
in the arena in the given order. The Bot
should avoid other color boxes when
trying to hit the target box in the arena.
After hitting all the three coloured
boxes ( For ex. Green, Violet, Blue), it
should reach Vision(RedBox) and
stop.
